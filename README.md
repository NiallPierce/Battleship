# Battleships Game

This is my take on the classic Battleships game. Placing your ships on a 10x10 grid a taking turns against the AI to see how can sink the other players ship by guessing their locations faster.

## How to Play
1. **Setup**: 
   - You and the AI will place ships on separate 10x10 grids.
   - Each player has ships of varying sizes (3, 4, and 5 units).
   - You will manually place your ships by entering a starting coordinate and specifying horizontal (H) or vertical (V) orientation.
   - The AI randomly places its ships on its grid.

2. **Gameplay**:
   - Players take turns to guess a location on the opponent's grid.
   - Enter a coordinate (e.g., A5) to attack that position.
   - The game will notify you if it's a **hit** (successful attack) or a **miss**.
   - If all segments of a ship are hit, the ship is sunk.
   - The AI also takes turns trying to sink your ships.
